Checking m3u playlists for functionality


Trying to make a script that will check m3u playlist links to media files and streams using python.
It requires installing third-party libraries that do not come with python "out of the box". You can use the command to install them:

`pip install colorama requests bs4 lxml pytube opencv-python`

To install libraries using requirements.txt, use the command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

For a more detailed description of the script, see the [article](https://codeby.net/threads/nemnogo-ob-iptv-ili-proverka-m3u-s-pomoschju-python-chast-02.81159/).
